/**
 * These queries are constructed to be for mobile first css.
 * You should write all styles for mobile and override things
 * at larger breakpoints where needed.
 *
 * You can use this query inside or outside of a class like so
 * @include breakpoint(tablet) {
 *    .someclass {color:red;}
 * }
 *
 * or
 *
 * .someclass {
 *    @include breakpoint(desktop) {
 *      color:blue;
 *    }
 * }
 *
 * It's rather lovely.
