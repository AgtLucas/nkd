Everything should just work. NKD just works.\r\nStart developing your jekyll prototype without any of the boring setup fuss.\r\n\r\nSite structure is as follows:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nnkd                               [Site root]\r\n├── README.md                     [What you're reading now]\r\n├── Rakefile                      [Rake sass, rake dev]\r\n├── _config.yml                   [Config for site. Site will run without config in defulat mode]\r\n├── _includes                     [Common includes I need for sites / pages]\r\n│   ├── _footer.html              [_BLANK_]\r\n│   ├── _head.html                [Common header elements]\r\n│   ├── _js_includes.html         [_BLANK_]\r\n│   └── _navigation_main.html     [_BLANK_]\r\n├── _layouts                      [Two layout files: default and post. both are identical by default.]\r\n│   ├── default.html      \r\n│   └── post.html\r\n├── _posts                        [Directory where you'd put posts...if you want any]\r\n├── _sass\r\n│   ├── _grid.scss                [Blank media queries. Not included or compiled to css]\r\n│   ├── i.scss                    [Includes normalize - compiles to i.css]\r\n│   └── normalize.scss            \r\n├── css\r\n│   ├── i.css\r\n└── index.html                    [index file that's served up at root. The \"homepage\" if you will.]\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nAs you can see a number of files are blank and not included by default. These are common assets I need to use. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Rake Tasks\r\n\r\n### rake dev\r\n    jekyll --auto --server\r\nUse this to start the jekyll server. It will auto generate a new site at _site every time you save a file.\r\n\r\n\r\n### rake sass\r\n    sass --watch _sass:css\r\nRun this to start the sass autocompiler. Compiles to /nkd/css/i.css on save.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
